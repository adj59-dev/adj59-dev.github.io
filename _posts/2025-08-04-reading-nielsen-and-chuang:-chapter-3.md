# Reading Nielsen and Chuang: Chapter 3

I just finished reading Chapter 3 of *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Nielsen and Chuang. 

I went to the History and further reading section of this chapter after reading the first couple of questions, since it was apparent I was missing important background knowledge. There, I saw the authors cite *Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines* by Minsky and a couple of articles by J.H. Conway as inspiration for the first four exercises in this chapter. I tracked down pdf copies of these texts and found them to be useful for in filling in some of the gaps.

A copy of Minsky's book can be found here: https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Martin.Emms/2062/PossReading/finite_and_infinite_machines_minsky.pdf

The Conway articles are here: <br>

### Models for computation - Key Concepts


| Concept                              | Book Section              | Notes                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Elements of a Turing machine         | section 3.1.1             | (1) a program <br> (2) a finite state control (acts like a stripped-down microprocessor) <br> (3) a tape (acts like memeory) <br> (4) a read-write tape-head (points to the position on the tape which is currently readable or writable) |
| Internal states of a Turing machine  | section 3.1.1             | The finite state control consists of a finite set of internal states, $q_1, \cdots, q_m$, the starting state $q_s$, and the halting state $q_h$. At the beginning of computation, the state is $q_s$. As computation executes the internal states change. If computation finishes the machine ends up in $q_h$. |
| Properties of the tape               | section 3.1.1             | The tape is a on-dimensional object of infinite length which consists of tape squares numbered $0, 1, 2, \cdots$ that each contain a symbol from some alphabet $\Gamma$. |
| Alphabet used in the book            | section 3.1.1             | $0, 1, b \text{ (blank)}, \triangleright \text{ (left edge of tape)}$       |
| Program for a Turing machine         | section 3.1.1             | Finite list of program lines in the form $\braket{q, x, q', x', s}$, where $q$ and $q'$ are internal states, $x$ and $x'$ are symbols from $\Gamma$, and $s$ is $-1$, $1$, or $0$ representing movement of the tape-head left, right, or stand still, respectively. On each machine cycle the Turing machine seaches the program lines in order for $\braket{q,x,\cdot,\cdot, \cdot}$ where $q$ is the current internal state and $x$ is the current symbol being read on the tape. If a program line is found, then that line is executed. If not, the internal state is set to $q_h$ and the machine halts. When executing a program line, the internal state is set to $q'$, the symbol $x$ on the tape is changed to $x'$, and the tape head moves based on $s$, unless asked to move farther left than the leftmost square, in which case it doesn't move. |
| Church-Turing thesis                 | section 3.1.1             | Any function that can be effectively computed by an algorithm can be computed by a Turing machine. This thesis is important because it provided a good definition for computability. | 


### Models for computation - Exercises
  
**Exercise 3.1** 

This question is about non-computable processes in Nature. The authors previously went into a more detailed discussion of the Church-Turing thesis in section 1.1.1. Interestingly, section 3.1.1 dropped the word "efficently" from the thesis and just focused on computability. Minsky chapter 5 discusses the idea of computability.

<summary>Solution</summary>

To recognize that a process in Nature computes a function not computable by a Turing machine, one would need to demonstrate that no Turing machine can reproduce the same input-output behavior. This typically involves proving that the function the process computes is non-computable. According to Minsky (Chapter 5), *“any procedure which can be precisely described can be programmed to be performed by a computer"*. Therefore, if a physical process yields results that cannot be captured by any precisely describable algorithm, it would suggest that the process computes a non-Turing-computable function. However, recognizing such a process in practice would be extraordinarily difficult, as it would require ruling out all possible Turing machine simulations.

**Exercise 3.2**

I found reading Minsky section 7.2 to be helpful in understanding what this question is asking us to do (and why it may be useful), which is to find a way of representing a given Turing machine's "state diagram" (the set of quintuples that represent its states, inputs, and outputs, i.e. what QCQI authors call the "program") as a unique number that can be used by a universal Turing machine to simulate that specific Turing machine. The Fractran article discusses encoding data in the exponent of a prime number in the prime factorization of the integer, which is also referenced in the hint for this exercise. I used that information to answer this question.

<summary>Solution</summary>

Let's say we have a program described by a finite list of program lines of the form $\braket{q, x, q', x', s}$ with a library consiting of $0, 1, b, \triangleright$, $-1$ for tape-head movement, internal states $q_1, \cdots, q_m$, the starting state $q_s$, and the halting state $q_h$, we can represent each symbol in the library and the different states as a non-negative integer as shown below

| Symbol           | Integer |
|------------------|---------|
| $-1$             | $1$     |
| $0$              | $2$     |
| $1$              | $3$     |
| $b$              | $4$     |
| $\triangleright$ | $5$     |
| $q_s$            | $6$     |
| $q_h$            | $7$     |
| $q_1$            | $8$     |
| $\vdots$         | $\vdots$ |
| $q_m$            | $7+m$   |


If we list out all the symbols and states in the program lines sequentially, like this

$$\begin{aligned}
q_1, x_1, q_1', x_1', s_1, q_2, x_2, q_2', x_2', s_2, \cdots q_k, x_k, q_k', x_k', s_k
\end{aligned}$$

Then you can generate a unique number to represent a Turing machine using the following equation

$$\begin{aligned}
N = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}p_3^{a_3}\cdots p_{5k}^{a_{5k}}
\end{aligned}$$

Where $p_1, \cdots, p_{5k}$ are unique prime numbers and $a_1, \cdots, a_{5k}$ are integers representing the symbols and states in the program lines.

**Exercise 3.3**

Here we are to describe a Turing machine which takes a binary number as input and outputs the bits in reverse order. I took inspiration from Minsky's parenthesis checker example (section 6.1.2) and the hint to use a multi-tape turing machine to create this solution. 

We will setup the machine with two tapes, one that has the input binary number followed by blank squares and the other is all blank.

The program is given as follows

| $q$              | $x_1$            | $x_2$            | $q'$             | $x_1'$           | $x_2'$           | $s_1$            | $s_2$            |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| $q_s$            | $\triangleright$ | $\triangleright$ | $q_1$            | $\triangleright$ | $\triangleright$ | $1$              | $1$              |
| $q_1$            | 1                | b                | $q_1$            | 1                | b                | $1$              | $0$              |
| $q_1$            | 0                | b                | $q_1$            | 0                | b                | $1$              | $0$              |
| $q_1$            | b                | b                | $q_2$            | b                | b                | $-1$             | $0$              |
| $q_2$            | 1                | b                | $q_2$            | 1                | 1                | $-1$             | $1$              |
| $q_2$            | 0                | b                | $q_2$            | 0                | 0                | $-1$             | $1$              |
| $q_2$            | $\triangleright$ | b                | $q_h$            | $\triangleright$ | b                | $0$              | $0$              |
