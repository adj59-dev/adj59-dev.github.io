This is the repository for my GitHub Pages site, where I post detailed notes and exercise solutions for several physics, math, and quantum-computing textbooks including:

- **Nielsen & Chuang — *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information*** (QCQI)  
- **Hamermesh — *Group Theory and Its Application to Physical Problems*** (GTAPP)

The live website is available at:
