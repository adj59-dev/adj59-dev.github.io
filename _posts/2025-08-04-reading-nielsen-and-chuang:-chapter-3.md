# Reading Nielsen and Chuang: Chapter 3

I just finished reading Chapter 3 of *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Nielsen and Chuang. 

I went to the History and further reading section of this chapter after reading the first couple of questions, since it was apparent I was missing important background knowledge. There, I saw the authors cite *Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines* by Minsky and a couple of articles by J.H. Conway as inspiration for the first four exercises in this chapter. I tracked down pdf copies of these texts and found them to be useful for in filling in some of the gaps.

A copy of Minsky's book can be found here: https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Martin.Emms/2062/PossReading/finite_and_infinite_machines_minsky.pdf

The Conway articles are here: <br>

### Models for computation - Key Concepts


| Concept                              | Book Section              | Notes                                                                                                  |

| Elements of a Turing machine         | section 3.1.1             | (1) a program <br> (2) a finite state control (acts like a stripped-down microprocessor) <br> (3) a tape (acts like memeory) <br> (4) a read-write tape-head (points to the position on the tape which is currently readable or writable) |
| Internal states of a Turing machine  | section 3.1.1             | The finite state control consists of a finite set of internal states, $q_1, \cdots, q_m$, the starting state $q_s$, and the halting state $q_h$. At the beginning of computation, the state is $q_s$. As computation executes the internal states change. If computation finishes the machine ends up in $q_h$. |
| Properties of the tape               | section 3.1.1             | The tape is a on-dimensional object of infinite length which consists of tape squares numbered $0, 1, 2, \cdots$ that each contain a symbol from some alphabet $\Gamma$. |
| Alphabet used in the book            | section 3.1.1             | $0, 1, b \text{ (blank)}, \triangleright \text{ (left edge of tape)}$       |
| Program for a Turing machine         | section 3.1.1             | Finite list of program lines in the form $\braket{q, x, q', x', s}$, where $q$ and $q'$ are internal states, $x$ and $x'$ are symbols from $\Gamma$, and $s$ is $-1$, $1$, or $0$ representing movement of the tape-head left, right, or stand still, respectively. On each machine cycle the Turing machine seaches the program lines in order for $\braket{q,x,\cdot,\cdot, \cdot}$ where $q$ is the current internal state and $x$ is the current symbol being read on the tape. If a program line is found, then that line is executed. If not, the internal state is set to $q_h$ and the machine halts. When executing a program line, the internal state is set to $q'$, the symbol $x$ on the tape is changed to $x'$, and the tape head moves based on $s$, unless asked to move farther left than the leftmost square, in which case it doesn't move. |
| Church-Turing thesis                 | section 3.1.1             | Any function that can be effectively computed by an algorithm can be computed by a Turing machine. This thesis is important because it provided a good definition for computability. | 


### Models for computation - Exercises
  
**Exercise 3.1** 

This question is about non-computable processes in Nature. The authors previously went into a more detailed discussion of the Church-Turing thesis in section 1.1.1. Interestingly, section 3.1.1 dropped the word "efficently" from the thesis and just focused on computability. Minsky chapter 5 discusses the idea of computability.

<summary>Solution</summary>

To recognize that a process in Nature computes a function not computable by a Turing machine, one would need to demonstrate that no Turing machine can reproduce the same input-output behavior. This typically involves proving that the function the process computes is non-computable. According to Minsky (Chapter 5), *â€œany procedure which can be precisely described can be programmed to be performed by a computer"*. Therefore, if a physical process yields results that cannot be captured by any precisely describable algorithm, it would suggest that the process computes a non-Turing-computable function. However, recognizing such a process in practice would be extraordinarily difficult, as it would require ruling out all possible Turing machine simulations.

**Exercise 3.2**

I found reading Minsky section 7.2 to be helpful in understanding what this question is asking us to do (and why it may be useful), which is to find a way of representing a given Turing machine's "state diagram" (the set of quintuples that represent its states, inputs, and outputs, i.e. what QCQI authors call the "program") as a unique number that can be used by a universal Turing machine to simulate that specific Turing machine. The Fractran article discusses encoding data in the exponent of a prime number in the prime factorization of the integer, which is also referenced in the hint for this exercise. I used that information to answer this question.

<summary>Solution</summary>

Let's say we have a program described by a finite list of program lines of the form $\braket{q, x, q', x', s}$ with a library consiting of $0, 1, b, \triangleright$, $-1$ for tape-head movement, internal states $q_1, \cdots, q_m$, the starting state $q_s$, and the halting state $q_h$, we can represent each symbol in the library and the different states as a non-negative integer as shown below

| Symbol           | Integer |
|------------------|---------|
| $-1$             | $1$     |
| $0$              | $2$     |
| $1$              | $3$     |
| $b$              | $4$     |
| $\triangleright$ | $5$     |
| $q_s$            | $6$     |
| $q_h$            | $7$     |
| $q_1$            | $8$     |
| $\vdots$         | $\vdots$ |
| $q_m$            | $7+m$   |


If we list out all the symbols and states in the program lines sequentially, like this

$$\begin{aligned}
q_1, x_1, q_1', x_1', s_1, q_2, x_2, q_2', x_2', s_2, \cdots q_k, x_k, q_k', x_k', s_k
\end{aligned}$$

Then you can generate a unique number to represent a Turing machine using the following equation

$$\begin{aligned}
N = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}p_3^{a_3}\cdots p_{5k}^{a_{5k}}
\end{aligned}$$

Where $p_1, \cdots, p_{5k}$ are unique prime numbers and $a_1, \cdots, a_{5k}$ are integers representing the symbols and states in the program lines.
