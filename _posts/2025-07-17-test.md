  **Exercise 2.1** 

In section 2.1.1 the authors introduce the concept of linear dependence and independence. In this exercise you use the definition of linear dependence to demonstrate that three vectors are linearly dependent.

<summary>Solution</summary> 

To show that these vectors are linearly dependent, we need to find a set of $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ such that

$$a_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\ -1 \end{bmatrix} + a_2 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\ 2 \end{bmatrix} + a_3 \begin{bmatrix} 2  \\\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = 0$$

This is true when $a_1=1, a_2=1,$ and $a_3=-1$. Therefore these vectors are linearly dependent.
