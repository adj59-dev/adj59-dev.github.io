I just finished reading Chapter 2 of *Group Theory And Its Application To Physical Problems* by Morton Hamermesh.

### Problem 1 {#page-45-problem-1}

Let $a$ be a rotation $2\pi/n$ about the n-fold axis, so $a^n=e$. Let $b$ be a $\pi$ rotation about one of the 2-fold axes, so $b^2=e$. Rotating the figure by $a$ carries the 2-fold axis of $b$ to another 2-fold axis, so $a^jba^{-j}$ is a 2-fold rotation for every integer $j$. Thus all 2-fold rotations lie in the subgroup $\braket{a,b}$. The subgroup $\braket{a,b}$ also contains all powers of $a$, so it contains all rotations about the n-fold axis. By definition $D_n$ is either a rotation about an n-fold axis or rotation about one of the perpendicular 2-fold axes, therefore $D_n=\braket{a,b}$. If we apply the rotation $bab$, we end up with a rotation that is equivilent to $a^{-1}$ and so $ba=a^{-1}b$. Then, $(ab)^2=abab=a(ba)b=a(a^{-1}b)b=(aa^{-1})(b^2)=e$. Therefore, $D_n$ is generated by two elements $a$, $b$, such that $a^n=b^2=(ab)^2=e$.
