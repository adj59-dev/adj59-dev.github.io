# Reading Nielsen and Chuang: Chapter 3

I just finished reading Chapter 3 of *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Nielsen and Chuang. 

I went to the History and further reading section of this chapter after reading the first couple of questions, since it was apparent that I was missing important background knowledge. Here are some of the resources that I found useful. 

*Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines* by Minsky: https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Martin.Emms/2062/PossReading/finite_and_infinite_machines_minsky.pdf <br>
*Computational Complexity* by Papadimitriou: http://103.203.175.90:81/fdScript/RootOfEBooks/E%20Book%20collection%20-%202023%20-%20E/CSE%20ITAIDSML/Computational%20Complexity%20-%20Papadimitriou.pdf

### Models for computation - Key Concepts


| Concept                              | Book Section              | Notes                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Elements of a Turing machine         | section 3.1.1             | (1) a program <br> (2) a finite state control (acts like a stripped-down microprocessor) <br> (3) a tape (acts like memeory) <br> (4) a read-write tape-head (points to the position on the tape which is currently readable or writable) |
| Internal states of a Turing machine  | section 3.1.1             | The finite state control consists of a finite set of internal states, $q_1, \cdots, q_m$, the starting state $q_s$, and the halting state $q_h$. At the beginning of computation, the state is $q_s$. As computation executes the internal states change. If computation finishes the machine ends up in $q_h$. |
| Properties of the tape               | section 3.1.1             | The tape is a on-dimensional object of infinite length which consists of tape squares numbered $0, 1, 2, \cdots$ that each contain a symbol from some alphabet $\Gamma$. |
| Alphabet used in the book            | section 3.1.1             | $0, 1, b \text{ (blank)}, \triangleright \text{ (left edge of tape)}$       |
| Program for a Turing machine         | section 3.1.1             | Finite list of program lines in the form $\braket{q, x, q', x', s}$, where $q$ and $q'$ are internal states, $x$ and $x'$ are symbols from $\Gamma$, and $s$ is $-1$, $1$, or $0$ representing movement of the tape-head left, right, or stand still, respectively. On each machine cycle the Turing machine seaches the program lines in order for $\braket{q,x,\cdot,\cdot, \cdot}$ where $q$ is the current internal state and $x$ is the current symbol being read on the tape. If a program line is found, then that line is executed. If not, the internal state is set to $q_h$ and the machine halts. When executing a program line, the internal state is set to $q'$, the symbol $x$ on the tape is changed to $x'$, and the tape head moves based on $s$, unless asked to move farther left than the leftmost square, in which case it doesn't move. |
| Church-Turing thesis                 | section 3.1.1             | Any function that can be effectively computed by an algorithm can be computed by a Turing machine. This thesis is important because it provided a good definition for computability. | 
| The halting problem                  | section 3.1.1             | A famous problem in computer science that asks whether it's possible to create a universal algorithm that can determine if any given program will halt or run forever. Alan Turing proved that such an algorithm cannot exist. |
| Circuit model                        | section 3.1.2             | Models computation in terms of wires and gates.                                                        |

### Models for computation - Exercises
  
**Exercise 3.1** 

This question is about non-computable processes in Nature. The authors previously went into a more detailed discussion of the Church-Turing thesis in section 1.1.1. Interestingly, section 3.1.1 dropped the word "efficently" from the thesis and just focused on computability. Minsky chapter 5 discusses the idea of computability. 

<details style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<summary>Solution</summary>

To recognize that a process in Nature computes a function not computable by a Turing machine, one would need to demonstrate that no Turing machine can reproduce the same input-output behavior. This typically involves proving that the function the process computes is non-computable. According to Minsky (Chapter 5), *â€œany procedure which can be precisely described can be programmed to be performed by a computer"*. Therefore, if a physical process yields results that cannot be captured by any precisely describable algorithm, it would suggest that the process computes a non-Turing-computable function.

**Exercise 3.2**

I found reading Minsky section 7.2 to be helpful in understanding what this question is asking us to do (and why it may be useful), which is to find a way of representing a given Turing machine's "state diagram" (the set of quintuples that represent its states, inputs, and outputs, i.e. what QCQI authors call the "program") as a unique number that can be used by a universal Turing machine to simulate that specific Turing machine. 

<details style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<summary>Solution</summary>

Let's say we have a program described by a finite list of program lines of the form $\braket{q, x, q', x', s}$ with a library consiting of $0, 1, b, \triangleright$, $-1$ for tape-head movement, internal states $q_1, \cdots, q_m$, the starting state $q_s$, and the halting state $q_h$, we can represent each symbol in the library and the different states as a non-negative integer as shown below

| Symbol           | Integer |
|------------------|---------|
| $-1$             | $1$     |
| $0$              | $2$     |
| $1$              | $3$     |
| $b$              | $4$     |
| $\triangleright$ | $5$     |
| $q_s$            | $6$     |
| $q_h$            | $7$     |
| $q_1$            | $8$     |
| $\vdots$         | $\vdots$ |
| $q_m$            | $7+m$   |


If we list out all the symbols and states in the program lines sequentially, like this

$$\begin{aligned}
q_1, x_1, q_1', x_1', s_1, q_2, x_2, q_2', x_2', s_2, \cdots q_k, x_k, q_k', x_k', s_k
\end{aligned}$$

Then you can generate a unique number to represent a Turing machine using the following equation

$$\begin{aligned}
N = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}p_3^{a_3}\cdots p_{5k}^{a_{5k}}
\end{aligned}$$

Where $p_1, \cdots, p_{5k}$ are unique prime numbers and $a_1, \cdots, a_{5k}$ are integers representing the symbols and states in the program lines.

**Exercise 3.3**

Here we are to describe a Turing machine which takes a binary number as input and outputs the bits in reverse order. I found it useful to look at examples in Minsky (section 6.1) and use a multi-tape turing machine to create this solution, as recommended in the hint. 

<details style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<summary>Solution</summary>

We will setup the machine with two tapes, one that has the input binary number followed by blank squares and the other is all blank. The program is setup to read the binary input from the first tape and print the bits in reverse order on the second. 

The program is given as follows

| $q$              | $x_1$            | $x_2$            | $q'$             | $x_1'$           | $x_2'$           | $s_1$            | $s_2$            |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| $q_s$            | $\triangleright$ | $\triangleright$ | $q_1$            | $\triangleright$ | $\triangleright$ | $1$              | $1$              |
| $q_1$            | 1                | b                | $q_1$            | 1                | b                | $1$              | $0$              |
| $q_1$            | 0                | b                | $q_1$            | 0                | b                | $1$              | $0$              |
| $q_1$            | b                | b                | $q_2$            | b                | b                | $-1$             | $0$              |
| $q_2$            | 1                | b                | $q_2$            | 1                | 1                | $-1$             | $1$              |
| $q_2$            | 0                | b                | $q_2$            | 0                | 0                | $-1$             | $1$              |
| $q_2$            | $\triangleright$ | b                | $q_h$            | $\triangleright$ | b                | $0$              | $0$              |

**Exercise 3.4**

For this exercise we are asked to describe a Turing machine which adds two binary numbers modulo 2. I also used two tapes for this machine. 

<details style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<summary>Solution</summary>

We will use two tapes for this machine. The first will contain the binary values and the second will start out blank. The program will first transfer the values for the first number to the second tape, then do a bit-wise XOR on the last digit of the two numbers, replacing the last value on the second tape with the results, then it will zero out the rest of the values on the second tape, so that the value on the second tape is the answer. 

The program is given as follows

| $q$              | $x_1$            | $x_2$            | $q'$             | $x_1'$           | $x_2'$           | $s_1$            | $s_2$            |

**Exercise 3.5**

In Box 3.2 the authors introduce the halting problem for a Turing machine with an input equal to its Turing number. For this exercise, we are asked to think about the halting problem for a Turing machine with no inputs. The blank tape halting problem is discussed by Minsky in section 8.3.3 of his book, if you'd like another resource for this exercise.

<summary>Solution</summary>

Let's say that we can create an algorithm to determine whether a Turing machine halts when the input to the machine is a blank tape. With this algorithm, we could take a machine $T$ with tape $t$ and make a new machine $M_T$ which is constructed from the description of $T$ with additional program lines. These additional lines will generate the output of $t$ on a blank tape at the start of the computation, such that $M_T$ starting with a blank tape is the equivalent of $T$ starting with tape $t$. Using the algorithm mentioned above, we can determine whether $M_T$ halts when the input to the machine is a blank tape, this means that using the algorithm we can determine if $T$ halts starting with tape $t$. 

From Box 3.2, we know that there is no algorithm that can be used to determine if a Turing machine with Turing number $x$ halts upon input of $x$. But with our algorithm we can determine if $T$ halts when $t=x$. We have a contradiction; therefore it is not possible to create an algorithm to determine whether a Turing machine halts when the input to the machine is a blank tape.

**Exercise 3.6**

In this exercise we are asked to revisit the halting problem again, but this time the Turing machine is probabilistic. On page 127, the autors talk about creating a probabilistic Turing machine by adding a random component to the change in internal states with the execution of each program line. I am not confident in my solution to this exercise, as I don't have much experience with this area of theoretical computer science, but I'll put what I have below. Let me know if you have a better solution.

<summary>Solution</summary>

The halting function is now

$$\begin{equation}
  h_p(x)=\begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if machine $x$ halts on input of $x$ with probability of at least $1/2$}.\\
    0, & \text{if machine $x$ halts on input of $x$ with a probability of less than $1/2$}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}$$

Let's say that the Turing machine halts with probability $P_h > 1/2$, which means that we expect $h_p = 1$. As with the example in Box 3.2 we'll consider an algorithm computing the function TURING($x$) with pseudocode. Here HALT($x$) is calculated for each execution of the algorithm, such that 

$$\begin{equation}
  \text{HALT}(x)=\begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if machine $x$ halts on input of $x$}.\\
    0, & \text{if machine $x$ does not halt on input of $x$}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}$$

Here we expect HALT($x$) to be 1 with a probability $P_h$ and 0 with the probability $1-P_h$. The pseudocode is then

```
TURING(x)

y = HALT(x)
if y = 0 then
  halt
else
  loop forever
end if
```

Each time this algorithm is run, there is a probability $P_h$ of getting $0$ and a probability of $1-P_h$ of it looping forever. This contradicts our expectations of it halting with probability $P_h$. If $P_h$ was not strictly greater than $1/2$, but instead allowed to be equal to $1/2$ then we could have the situation where $P_h = 1-P_h$, and there would be no contradiction, but we're wanting to find a case where the probability of correctness is strictly greater than $1/2$. Putting this in terms of our halting function, we find that $h_p = 0$, but we know that $h_p = 1$. Therefore, there is a contradiction and so there is no probabilistic Turing machine which can output $h_p(x)$ with probability of correctness strictly greater than $1/2$ for all $x$.

**Exercise 3.7**

This exercise asks if adding an oracle to a Turing machine resolves the halting problem. 

<details style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<summary>Solution</summary>

An oracle machine with access to a halting problem oracle for standard Turing machines can decide whether any given Turing machine halts. However, no oracle machine can solve its own halting problem, by a similar argument to the one that shows no Turing machine can decide its own halting behavior.

### The analysis of computational problems - Exercises

**Exercise 3.9**

For this exercise we are to prove that $f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$ if and only if $g(n)$ is $\Omega (f(n))$ and that $f(n)$ is $\Theta (g(n))$ if and only if $g(n)$ is $\Theta (f(n))$. We can do this using the details I listed in the notes above for these different notations.

<details style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<summary>Solution</summary>

We know that $f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$ if $f(n) \leq cg(n)$ for some constant $c$ and for all $n \geq n_0$. We also know that $g(n)$ is $\Omega (f(n))$ if $g(n) \geq c'f(n)$ for some constant $c'$ and for all $n \geq n_0'$. If we set $c = \frac{1}{c'}$ and $n_0 = n_0'$, then we can see that the two inequalities are identical. Therefore, $f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$ if and only if $g(n)$ is $\Omega (f(n))$.

We know that $f(n)$ is $\Theta (g(n))$ when $f(n)$ behaves the same as $g(n)$ asymptotically. When this is the case, we can also say that $g(n)$ behaves the same as $f(n)$ asymptotically and so $g(n)$ is $\Theta (f(n))$. 

</details>


**Exercise 3.10**

For this exercise we are to show that a polynomial of degree $k$ is $O(n^l)$ for any $l \geq k$.

<details style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<summary>Solution</summary>

To show that $g(n)$ is $O(n^l)$ we need to show that $g(n) \leq cn^l$ for some real positive constant $c$ and for all $n \geq n_0$ for some $n_0$. We know that $g(n) = \sum_{i=0}^k c_i n^i$. If we set $c=c_k$, then $c_k n^k + \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} c_i n^i \leq c_k n^l$. For sufficiently large $n$ the lower order terms on the left hand side become small compared to the $k\text{th}$ term and can be ignored, so we have $c_k n^k \leq c_k n^l$, which is always true. Therefore a polynomial of degree $k$ is $O(n^l)$ for any $l \geq k$.

</details>


**Exercise 3.11**

Show that log $n$ is $O(n^k)$ for any $k > 0$.

<details style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<summary>Solution</summary>

To show that log $n$ is $O(n^k)$ for any $k > 0$ we need to show that the following is true for some real positive constant $c$ and $n_0$ for all $n>n_0$

$$\begin{aligned}
\log n & \leq cn^k \\
n & \leq e^{cn^k} & \text{take the exponential of both sides} \\
n & \leq \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{(cn^k)^i}{i!} & \text{power series for an exponential function} \\
n & \leq \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{c^i n^{ik}}{i!} \\
n & \leq \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{\left(\log_{i'}(i'!) \right)^i n^{ik}}{i!} & \text{let $c=\log_{i'}(i'!)$ where $i'$ is the first $i$ such that $i'k \geq 1$} \\
n & \leq \frac{\left(\log_{i'}(i'!) \right)^{i'} n^{i'k}}{i'!} + \sum_{i=0}^{i'-1} \frac{\left(\log_{i'}(i'!) \right)^i n^{ik}}{i!} + \sum_{i=i'+1}^\infty \frac{\left(\log_{i'}(i'!) \right)^i n^{ik}}{i!} & \text{split out the $i'$th term}\\
n & \leq n^{i'k} + \sum_{i=0}^{i'-1} \frac{\left(\log_{i'}(i'!) \right)^i n^{ik}}{i!} + \sum_{i=i'+1}^\infty \frac{\left(\log_{i'}(i'!) \right)^i n^{ik}}{i!}
\end{aligned}$$ 

Since we know $i'k \geq 1$ and all the terms in the summations are positive, we know the inequality is true and therefore log $n$ is $O(n^k)$.

</details>


**Exercise 3.12**

Show that $n^{\log n}$ is super-polynomial.

<details style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<summary>Solution</summary>

We need to show that $n^k \leq c n^{\log n}$ for some real positive constant $c$, some $n_0$, and any $k$ for $n \geq n_0$.

$$\begin{aligned}
n^k & \leq cn^{\log n} \\
k & \leq \log_n (cn^{\log n}) & \text{take $log_n$ of both sides}\\
k & \leq \log_n (c) + \log_n(\log n) \\
k & \leq k + \log_n(\log n) & \text{set $\log_n (c) = k$ }
\end{aligned}$$ 

It can be seen that this inequality is true when $\log_n(\log n) \geq 0$, which will happen for all $n \geq 2$, since $\log$ is base $2$ when not specified as something else in this book. This shows that $n^k$ is $O(n^{\log n})$ for any $k$ and $n^{\log n}$ is never $O(n^k)$. 

</details>


**Exercise 3.13**

Show that $n^{\log n}$ is sub-exponential.

<details style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<summary>Solution</summary>

We need to show that $c^n \geq a n^{\log n}$ for some real positive constant $a$, some $n_0$, and any $c > 1$ for $n \geq n_0$.

$$\begin{aligned}
c^n & \geq a n^{\log n} \\
n & \geq \log_c(a n^{\log n}) & \text{take $log_c$ of both sides} \\
n & \geq \log_c (a) + \log_c(n^{\log n}) \\
n & \geq \log_c (a) + \log(n)\log_c(n) \\
n & \geq \log(n)\log_c(n) & \text{set $a=1$} \\
n & \geq \frac{(\log(n))^2}{\log (c)} & \text{changing the base}
\end{aligned}$$ 

We know that $n$ grows faster than $(\log(n))^2$ (this can easily be seen by taking the derivative of both functions) and so the above inequality will be true for sufficiently large $n$ and $c>1$. 

</details>


**Exercise 3.14**

Suppose $e(n)$ is $O(f(n))$ and $g(n)$ is $O(h(n))$. Show that $e(n)g(n)$ is $O(f(n)h(n))$. 

<details style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<summary>Solution</summary>

Since $e(n)$ is $O(f(n))$ we know that $e(n) \leq cf(n)$ for some real positive constant $c$ and for all $n \geq n_0$. Also since $g(n)$ is $O(h(n))$ we know that $g(n) \leq dh(n)$ for some real positive constant $d$ and for all $n \geq n_1$. To show that $e(n)g(n)$ is $O(f(n)h(n))$, we need to show that $e(n)g(n) \leq b f(n)h(n)$ for some real positive constant $b$ and for all $n \geq n_2$. 

$$\begin{aligned}
e(n)g(n) \leq b f(n)h(n) \\
e(n)g(n) \leq cd f(n)h(n) & \text{let $b = cd$} \\
e(n)g(n) \leq (c f(n))(d h(n))
\end{aligned}$$ 

Since we know that $e(n) \leq cf(n)$ for $n \geq n_0$ and $g(n) \leq dh(n)$ for $n \geq n_1$ we know that the above inequality is true for $n \geq n_2$ where $n_2 = \max(n_0, n_1)$. 

</details>


**Exercise 3.15**

In this exercise we are to show that the lower bounds of a compare-and-swap sorting algorithm is $O(n \log n)$. You will need to use Stirling's approximation to do this. 

<details style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<summary>Solution</summary>

There are $n!$ possible initial orderings of the list. Below is a table that shows how many of those orderings $n_k$ are in the correct order after $k$ compare-and-swaps. 

| $k$ | $n_k$ | Note                                                                      |
|-----|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0   | 1     | With zero swaps only the ordering that started in order is in the correct order |
| 1   | 2     | With one compare-and-swap, two entries are compared and only the ordering that had those two entries out of order is put in order with the swap. The ordering that was already in order stays in order since the two values which were compared are not swapped. |
| 2   | 4     | The two scenarios from above still occur in this case. But now another pair is compared, so we have the added possibility of the first pair not swapping and second pair swapping and also the possibility of both pairs swapping. |
| 3   | 8     | Possibilities: zero pairs swapping, only the first pair swapping, only the second pair swapping, only the third pair swapping, first and second pair swapping, second and third pair swapping, first and third pair swapping, all pairs swapping | 
| k   | 2^k   | Continuing the trend we find that there are $2^k$ possible combinations    |

In order to find how many compare-and-swap operations are required to sort all possible combinations we need to find $k$ when $n! = 2^k$. 

$$\begin{aligned}
2^k &= n! \\
k &= \log(n!) & \text{take the log of both sides} \\
k & \approx n\log(n) - n\log(e) + O(\log (n)) & \text{Stirling's approximation} 
\end{aligned}$$ 

Now to confirm that this $k$ is $\Omega (n\log(n))$ we need to show that $k \geq c n\log(n)$ for some real positive constant $c$ and for all $n \geq n_0$. 

$$\begin{aligned}
 k \geq c n\log(n) \\
 n\log(n) - n\log(e) + O(\log (n)) \geq c n\log(n) \\
\end{aligned}$$ 

For sufficiently large $n$ the left-hand side is dominated by the $n\log(n)$ term and so if $c<1$ the above inequalitiy will be true for $n > n_0$ for some value of $n_0$. Therefore $\Omega (n\log(n))$ compare-and-swap operations are required to sort all possible initial orderings into the correct order.

**Exercise 3.16**

This exercise asks us to find an example of a hard to compute function. For this you first need to find the number of possible Boolean functions that can be created with $n$ inputs. Then find the number of circuit configurations that can be created with $m$ logic gates. Finally find the minimum number of gates needed to create all possible Boolean functions with $n$ inputs. Note: the online errata page (https://michaelnielsen.org/qcqi/errata/errata/errata.html) says that $2^n/\log(n)$ should be $2^n/n$. 

This problem is challenging, and I ended up referencing the following resources to find and understand the solution. I did change some steps in my solution compared to what is in these resources. These changes did not impact the final result - it just made more sense to me to do it that way.  <br>

<details style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<summary>Solution</summary>

We know a Boolean function takes $n$ input bits and outputs a single bit, $f:\\{0,1\\}^n \rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$. With $n$ bits there are $2^n$ possible distinct input combinations. With each input combination there are two possible outcomes, meaning that there are $2^{2^n}$ possible functions. Below is an example of all 16 possible functions for the case of $n=2$.

|$n_1$|$n_2$|$f_1$|$f_2$|$f_3$|$f_4$|$f_5$|$f_6$|$f_7$|$f_8$|$f_9$|$f_{10}$|$f_{11}$|$f_{12}$|$f_{13}$|$f_{14}$|$f_{15}$|$f_{16}$|

|**0**|**1**| 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0      | 1      | 1      | 0      | 1      | 1      | 1      |
|**1**|**1**| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1      | 1      | 0      | 1      | 1      | 1      | 1      |


Let's say that we have a collection of circuits, each created with $m$ logic gates. We'd like to know what the maximum number of distinct circuits we can create with the $n$ inputs and $m \geq n-1$ logic gates with two-inputs (you need at least $n-1$ two-input gates to take $n$ inputs and reduce it to one output). For each of the gates there are $16$ possible logic functions, as we showed in the table above. Each of the two gate inputs can come from either the inputs $n$ or the output from one of the other $m-1$ gates, resulting in $(n + m - 1)^2$ possible combination of inputs, and so there are $16(n+m-1)^2$ ways to create each gate, except for the output gate which is specifically defined. This results in $m(16(n+m-1)^2)^{m-1}$ possible circuit configurations. However, this calculation is overcounting due to their being multiple permutations of the gates. This estimation can be tightened by dividing by $m!$ which gives us $\frac{m\left( 16(n+m-1)^2 \right)^{m-1}}{m!}$ possible circuit configurations. 

Now we have an equation that bounds the number of circuits configurations that one can create with $m$ gates and $n$ inputs. We also know the number of Boolean functions possible with $n$ inputs. So now what we want to find is the minimum number of gates needed to create a circuit for each possible Boolean function, i.e. we need to find an $m$ such that the number of possible circuit configurations is greater than or equal to the number of Boolean functions we can create with $n$ inputs. 

First let's write out and simplify the inequality

$$\begin{aligned}
2^{2^n} &\leq \frac{m\left( 16(m+n-1)^2 \right)^{m-1}}{m!} \\
&\leq \frac{m\left( 16(m+m)^2 \right)^{m-1}}{m!} & \text{since $m \geq n-1$} \\
&= \frac{m\left( 64(m)^2 \right)^{m-1}}{\sqrt{2\pi m}\left(\frac{m}{e} \right)^m \left(1 + O\left(\frac{1}{m} \right) \right)} & \text{Stirling's formula} \\
&= \frac{(m)^{m - 3/2} (64e)^{m-1}}{\sqrt{2\pi} \left(1 + O\left(\frac{1}{m} \right) \right)}\\
2^n &\leq \log\left( \frac{(m)^{m - 3/2} (64e)^{m-1}}{\sqrt{2\pi} \left(1 + O\left(\frac{1}{m} \right) \right)} \right) & \text{take the log of both sides} \\
&= \log\left((m)^{m - 3/2}\right) + \log\left((64e)^{m-1} \right)- \log\left( \sqrt{2\pi} \left(1 + O\left(\frac{1}{m} \right) \right) \right) \\
&= (m - \frac{3}{2})\log\left(m\right) + (m-1)\log\left(64e \right)- \log\left( \sqrt{2\pi} \left(1 + O\left(\frac{1}{m} \right) \right) \right) \\
&= m\log\left(m\right) - \frac{3}{2}\log\left(m\right) + m\log\left(64e \right) - \log\left(64e \right)- \log\left( \sqrt{2\pi} \left(1 + O\left(\frac{1}{m} \right) \right) \right) \\
&= m\log\left(m\right) + O(m)
\end{aligned}$$

Now let's write both sides of the inequality $2^n \leq m\log\left(m\right) + O(m)$ in more easily comparable forms. 

$$\begin{aligned}
m\log\left(m\right) + O(m) &\geq 2^n \\
&= 2^n - \frac{2^n}{n}\log\left(n\right) + \frac{2^n}{n}\log\left(n\right) \\
&= \frac{2^n}{n}\left(n - \log\left(n\right)\right) + \frac{2^n}{n}\log\left(n\right)\\
&= \frac{2^n}{n}\left(n\log\left(2\right) - \log\left(n\right)\right) + \frac{2^n}{n}\log\left(n\right)\\
&= \frac{2^n}{n}\left(\log\left(2^n\right) - \log\left(n\right)\right) + \frac{2^n}{n}\log\left(n\right)\\
&= \frac{2^n}{n}\log\left(\frac{2^n}{n}\right) + \frac{2^n}{n}\log\left(n\right)
\end{aligned}$$

If we set $m = \frac{2^n}{n}$ then we would have $\frac{2^n}{n}\log(\frac{2^n}{n}) + O\left( \frac{2^n}{n}\right) \geq \frac{2^n}{n}\log\left(\frac{2^n}{n}\right) + \frac{2^n}{n}\log\left(n\right)$, which is not true for sufficiently large $n$, this means that $m$ must be greater than $\frac{2^n}{n}$ for at least some Boolean functions. Therefore there exists Boolean functions with $n$ inputs that require at least $\frac{2^n}{n}$ logic gates to compute.

**Exercise 3.17**

For this exercise we are to prove that a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the factors of a number $m$ exist if and only if the factoring decision problem is **P**. The factoring decision problem is as follows: given a composite interger $m$ and $l<m$, does $m$ have a non-trival factor less than $l$? 

<details style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<summary>Solution</summary>

Suppose we have a polynomial-time algorithm that can find a non-trivial factor of a composite number $m$. Then we could solve the factoring decision problem in polynomial time as follows:

1.	Use the factor-finding algorithm to obtain all factors $n_i$ of $m$. 
2.	For each $n_i$ check whether $n_i<l$, which is a simple comparison and can be done in polynomial time.
3.	Report yes if at least one $n_i$ is less than $l$ and no otherwise

Thus, if finding non-trivial factors is in **P**, then the factoring decision problem is also in **P**.

Conversely, suppose we can solve the factoring decision problem in polynomial time for any input $(m, l)$. Then we can find the smallest non-trivial factor $s$ of $m$ by performing a binary search over the range $2$ to $m-1$ using the decision problem as an oracle. Each step of the binary search involves asking whether a factor exists below a certain bound $l$, which takes polynomial time. 

Once we find $s$ we can calculate $r=\frac{m}{s}$ and recursively apply the same method to $r$. We repeat this process until all factors are found. Since binary search requires only $O(\log m)$ calls, the entire procedure runs in polynomial time. Therefore, if the factoring decision problem is in **P**, then finding the factors is also in **P**.

**Exercise 3.18**

For this exercise we are to prove that if **coNP** $\neq$ **NP** then **P** $\neq$ **NP**. 

Languages in **NP** have 'yes' instances that can easily be verified in polynomial time with the aid of an appropriate witness. Languages in **coNP** have 'no' instances that can easily be verified in polynomial time with the aid of an appropriate witness. Languages in **P** can be decided by a Turing machine in polynomial time. **P** is both **NP** and **coNP**, but whether **NP** and **coNP** is **P** remains an open question. 

**NP** and **coNP** are complements of each other. In Papadimitriou (section 7.1) a complement complexity class $C$ is defined as the class $\\{ \bar{L} : L \in C \\}$, where $\bar{L}$ is the complement of language $L$. If C is **P** then coC is also **P** because any deterministic Turing machine deciding $L$ will decide $\bar{L}$ within the same time or space bound since it is the same machine with only the roles of "yes" and "no" reversed.
