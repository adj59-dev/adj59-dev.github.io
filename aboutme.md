title: About Me
---

My name is Alex Johnson. I have a background in experimental condensed matter physics, with a focus on two-dimensional semiconductors. After receiving my PhD, I moved into semiconductor manufacturing, specializing in electron-beam lithography.

I’m currently between roles as my partner and I work through the two-body problem. With some additional free time, I’m using this opportunity to study quantum computation and quantum information, a field I had seriously considered for my PhD but ultimately did not pursue. I’m posting my notes and solutions here primarily for my own bookkeeping, but also in case others find them useful.
